Random Forest Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn
Overview
Random Forest is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm based on ensemble learning. In this project, we implement two Random Forest Classifier models to predict the safety of cars using the Car Evaluation Data Set obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The first model consists of 10 decision trees, while the second model consists of 100 decision trees. We also explore feature selection using Random Forest to identify important features and assess their impact on model accuracy.

Instructions for Running the Code
To run the code, make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and category_encoders. You can install these libraries using pip, for example:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn category-encoders
Once the libraries are installed, you can run the provided Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the code. Make sure to adjust the file paths if necessary to match the location of your dataset.

Conclusion
Random Forest is a versatile algorithm known for its accuracy and robustness in both classification and regression tasks. In this project, we demonstrated how Random Forest can be used for car safety prediction and feature selection. By fine-tuning parameters and selecting important features, we improved model accuracy and gained insights into the underlying data.

Feel free to explore further by experimenting with different parameters, feature engineering techniques, or applying Random Forest to other datasets for various classification tasks.
